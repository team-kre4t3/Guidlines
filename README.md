# Guidlines
  - Everyone has to be nice to everyone
  - You should not be rude to anyone in chats and by no means you should say something that offends somebody.
  - Deadlines given are to be strictly followed.
  - Failure to give updates would result in warnings and repeated warnings would result in removal of that person from the group.
  - Do not let this affect your personal friendships, this is strictly professional.
  - You DO NOT have the authority to monetise any of the group projects.
